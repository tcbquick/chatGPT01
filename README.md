initial chatgpt request to setup my BeaglePlay

```
Please create me a bash script to install ansible on my BeaglePlay arm device that is using the latest Debian OS and has a hostname of Ansible-Con-troller with an ip address of 192.168.0.100. Then create an ansible-playbook for it to install docker and a local docker registry on port 5555. Additionally, build an ansible-playbook to add several more devices for my application using docker swarm, one RaspberryPi5 hostname is Main-Con-troller with ip address 192.168.0.200, one RaspberryPi400 hostname Main-Con-sole with ip address 192.168.0.201, RaspberryPiZero2w hostname Main-Con-nection with ip address 192.168.0.202 as swarm managers with a quorum of 3 and an additional five RaspberryPiZero2w's as swarm workers. Also create an ansible-playbook to create the following list of users for my application: ansible, arduino, omada, venus, department-of-defense, department-of-energy, department-of-state, and provide all users Docker permissions. Please format your results in the form of a storybook with an executive summary, index, chapters, glossary, illustrations, and an addendum containing a transcript of my request.
