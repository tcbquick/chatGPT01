# chatGPT01
initial chatgpt request to setup my BeaglePlay

```
Please create me a bash script to install ansible on my BeaglePlay arm device that is using the latest Debian OS and has a hostname of Ansible-Con-troller with an ip address of 192.168.0.100. Then create an ansible-playbook for it to install docker and a local docker registry on port 5555. Additionally, build an ansible-playbook to add several more devices for my application using docker swarm, one RaspberryPi5 hostname is Main-Con-troller with ip address 192.168.0.200, one RaspberryPi400 hostname Main-Con-sole with ip address 192.168.0.201, RaspberryPiZero2w hostname Main-Con-nection with ip address 192.168.0.202 as swarm managers with a quorum of 3 and an additional five RaspberryPiZero2w's as swarm workers. Also create an ansible-playbook to create the following list of users for my application: ansible, arduino, omada, venus, department-of-defense, department-of-energy, department-of-state, and provide all users Docker permissions. Please format your results in the form of a storybook with an executive summary, index, chapters, glossary, illustrations, and an addendum containing a transcript of my request.

Also create an ansible-playbook to create the following list of users for my application: ansible, arduino, omada, venus, department-of-defense, department-of-energy, department-of-state, and provide all users Docker permissions. my application uses cron to run shell script Jobs and shell script python Tasks for  automated jobs and tasks. therefore create cron Jobs using ansible to build tar backup jobs for each user to backup each users files.

My application uses cron to run shell script Jobs and shell script Python Tasks for automated jobs and tasks. Therefore, create cron jobs using Ansible to build tar backup jobs for each user to backup each user's files every day at 03:01. Then create an NGINX web page to run on the Ansible-Con-troller port 8888 to display a list of the backup tar files. Also create the Ansible playbook to install Portainer on Main-Con-troller using a role named portainer.
